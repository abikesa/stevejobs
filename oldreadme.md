```

1. Construct
   - Productline
     - [Funny, the ship that leaks from the top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzH54FpWAP0)
     - I don't understand that
   - Reinforcement learning
   - Customer/Human feedback
   - `Quick response` with simple productline
   - No grand ideas!!!
2. Language
   - Broadcast + iPod = Podcast
     - Did ya know?
     - Now that is Semantics
     - You're not using spectrum, its internet
     - And therefore no FCC regulation
     - Worldwide
   - [Comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzH54FpWAP0)
     - Steve had that special power of speech, he could explain something so coherently and simply
       - Phonetics
         - And resonant affect with consonant sonics
       - Syntax
         - Which begets terse syntax
       - [Values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM4If6YHN3s)
         - He'd `semantic vision`
   - [Marketing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM4If6YHN3s)
   - Noisy world
   - Gotta be really clear to the world "about us"
   - Our values
   - Affect, not facts
   - Dairy industry "Got Milk?" (talks about the absence of the product)
   - Nike sells shoes but their ads never talk about their product
     - They honor great athletes and athletics
     - Its who they are
     - What they are about
   - `Branding`
3. Agent
   - Steve Jobs
     - Apple's greatest successes have not been in the Fortune 500 companies
     - Part of that is that we are not very good at going through offices to get to end-users
     - There are 500 men and women in the Fortune 500, CIOs, that you have to go through
     - We've never really been good at that
     - [Not in Apple DNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzH54FpWAP0) to go through these offices
     - Four carriers are telling phone manufacturers what to build; we don't like that
     - We don't walk through the hallways to reach 500 CIOs
     - Just so we could reach the end-user
     - Going directly to the end-user is how we do it
4. Modifier
   - Compute
     - $\text{Iterate}^N$
   - Supply Chain
   - Tim Cook
   - [Uses & abuses of history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpzvwkR1RYU)
     - `Reverence`
       - He revered Nike's brand and its advertizing
     - `Inference`
       - Channeled Nike by going for exemplars
       - Introduced great athletes with its iPod shuffle!
       - But otherwise, all the `Think: Different` Geniuses in its 1997 ads
         - Einstein
         - MLK
         - Gandhi
         - Amelia Earhart
         - Leonardo da Vinci
         - Beatles
           - John Lenon
         - Dylan
         - Jim Henson
         - Martin Scorsese
         - Andy Warhol
         - Alan Turing
         - Grace Hopper
         - Steve Wozniak
        - [Xerox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqSfFcaluHc) Park: Palo Alto Center
          - Steve says he was blinded by their GUIs and was inspired to produce the Mac
          - But they also had 100 computers that were networked for email in 1979
          - And also had pioneered in object-oriented programming
          - Internet is the means by which companies learn through `RLHF` + $\text{Iterations}^N$
          - Of course this is by cutting out middlemen and shortening the feedback loop
     - `Deliverence`
       - Steve delivered Apple from too many products
       - Absence of soul
5. Verb
   - Distribution
   - `Iterate`
6. [Outcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXO0fSCEv5A)
   - [Simpler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMSa9sSZpF8)
   - Better
     - Our goal was to bring a liberal arts perspective
     - And a liberal arts audience
     - To what was a Geeky thing
     - We introduced fonts
     - Computer science is a liberal art that everyone should harness
     - Shouldn't be relegated to 5% of the population
   - Misfits change things
     - They push the human race forward
     - You call them crazy
     - We see genius
